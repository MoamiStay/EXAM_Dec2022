# Setup
Copy repo:  
git clone git@github.com:MoamiStay/EXAM_Dec2022.git  

npm i  
npm run build  
npm rum preview  

# Planning
![Gantt Chart](./submission/images/Gantt_regine.jpg?raw=true "Gantt Chart")

# Also note

HTML:   verification: I have consistently been putting buttons inside a tags. (on index and view listing) But I didn't realize until too late and didn't have time to fix it. It also gives a warning about missing heading in "View listing", however the headning is added as the title of the listing being the h1 through js.
WCAG:   ![Color-blind WCAG](./submission/images/colorblindWcag.jpg?raw=true "Color-blind WCAG")
![Color contrast WCAG](./submission/images/colorContrast.jpg?raw=true "Color contrast WCAG") <br>
The light blue color that is primerely used on buttons is slightly lacking in contrast. Would adjust, but ran out of time.

* issues with credits/avatar. The page struggles to load avatar and credits. I should have made a better solution for saving and getting the avatar and credits. (It does work, just not most of the time..). I would rather try to create a function to store values in localstorage from the initial login, but I did not have time to redo this part. 
* styling is lacking compared to the figma prototype. Working with tailwind was more time-consuming than expected.
* modules got a bid confused and mixed up towards the end. It was due to poor planning prior to starting the implementation. Learned from mistakes and feel confident that I will provide more optimal code and usage of moduels in the future.
* Ran out of time to set up any kind og testing.

* Hade some issues with setting up netlify due to the path to the index.html, so I setup the page manually by using local files. The hosted page is fully up to date with the most recent commit.
